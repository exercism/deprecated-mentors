### Intro
This is the first core exercise. 

### Reasonable solutions

```ruby
class TwoFer
  def self.two_fer(name = 'you')
    "One for #{name}, one for me."
  end
end
```

### Common suggestions
- Suggest using a default value instead of any form of conditionals. 
- People often set the default of `name` to be `nil`. Ask if there is something they could do with the default value to avoid the conditional and make their code simpler.
- Suggest to remove 'return'
- Use `def` with parentheses, because of the parameter.

### Talking points
- Implicit returns
- Default values
- String interpolation
- Style preferences. With everything else in order, this is a good opportunity to talk about style conventions like indentation, parameter parenthesis in method declarations and removing redundant comments.

Given the place in the curriculum, it may be worth to not going to deep, and to not addressing points that are controversial or personal preference. 

### Mentoring notes
- A friendly standard answer about how this can be done in one line, and a 'hint: use a different default value' to get rid of the conditionals, will be all you need for maybe 90% of the submissions. 
- Most mentors seem to ignore the use of either `self.two_fer` or `class << self`. That is appropriate to where we are in the track. 
- Every now and then there is a submission that makes TwoFer a module instead of a class.
